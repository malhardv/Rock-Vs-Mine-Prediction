---ROCK VS MINE PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION

A Machine Learning model that predicts that the object is a ROCK or a MINE using the Sonar Data that is available. It uses Logistic Regression to classify the data point in two categories that are: 
ROCK and MINE


MODULES USED -
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model
4. accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
5. train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
